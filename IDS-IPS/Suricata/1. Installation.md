For this lab, I'll be using a Debian desktop, but you can use a different distribution if you wish.
In this case, I'll be using Suricata as a host-based intrusion detection system (IDS), but I'll also guide you step-by-step if you want to use this tool as an intrusion prevention system (IPS).
The goal of this lab is to analyze the traffic entering and exiting our machine to gain greater control over the traffic passing through it.
